            <h1><strong>What Did I Do During Quarantine?</strong></h1>
            <p>During this quarantine, I have learned new hobbies and fun activities to do in my free time.
            To make sure I'm exercising everyday, I do home workouts or workout outside. I bike around my community, jog or walk 
        with my family. Furthermore, I played more sports, such as badminton, basketball and frisbee. I began to like exercising, and definitely would consider it as one of my hobbies. Since I wasn't able to meet 
        with my friends, we often video-chatted through zoom or facetime. I also began to learn more about politics,
        and watched several videos on different people's views on important issues. Here's a quote from the BLM website:<blockquote cite="https://www.blacklivesmatter.com"><i>"Black Lives Matter is a central target of disinformation and you are a key line of defense. Report suspicious sites, stories, ads, social accounts, and posts about BLM."</i></blockquote> Additionally, I started to re-decorate my room with my drawings,posters,
        and cut-outs from magazines. My room is nowadays becoming more clean and orgainzed, and I fold my clothes on time. Overall,
        during this quarantine, I found myself to have better time-management and free time and school was not in the way of it much often.</p>

            <p><h2>What were my meals like?</h2>Since I had a lot of free time, I found my self eating snacks whenever I 
               was bored. To fix this issue, I realize I needed to cut down the sugar I was taking in everyday. Therefore, I began to trade sugary snacks
               for fruits and vegetables. I also started to drink more water which resulted in clear skin. Eating more healthy also boosted my energy everyday.
               In conclusion, my meals were more balanced and healthy.
